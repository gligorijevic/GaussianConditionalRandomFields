%% Syntax
% function [ae, se, lpd, mrse, smse, msll] = loss(y, yp_m, yp_se2)
%
%
%% Description
% Function computes several frequently used perforamnce values. It can be
% used with one-step-ahead prediction or simulation results. 
%
% Input: 
% * y      ... target output values (=system output, ground truth) 
% * yp_m   ... predicted output mean values (=model output) 
% * yp_se2 ... predicted output variances   (=sigma*1e2 )
% 
% Output: 
% * ae     ... mean absolute error 
% * se     ... mean squared error 
% * lpd    ... log-predicted loss
% * mrse   ... mean relative square error 
% * smse   ... standardized mean squared error
% * msll   ... mean standardized log loss
% Examples:
